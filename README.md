# CodingSavedMyLife
Website that is currently saving my life 


-------------------------------------------

Above is the original README file I wrote back in 2018. What you see in "Original" is a untouched version of my most accomplished development project when I first decided to let coding save me from a mental health crisis 6 years ago. Unfortunatly I did not continue to keep this repository updated through the years as my skill set improved and so did my life. So this is firstly a recap of where I have been along with where I am now as far as development capabilities and mental health go. This will be updated going forward after this initinal push. My story will be posted in due time I appreciate anyone who gives it a look and laughs at the absolutely god awful code I seem to stil be producing even 6 years later. 

- Coding Saved My Life 4/6/2024


It is 2016 I am a Level 1 network support technician at a local ISP. I work midnight to 8 am and that stays the same for several years. A combination of no social interaction due to my job and no ability to create or maintain meaningful relationships had me at my lowest point. This is obviously simplyfing and I will touch on more detail as the story goes on. This is my story.
